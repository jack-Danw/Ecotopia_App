  This is a project that was made for a presentation, a simple app that looks like it works but actually doesnt.

  Made using Ionic + Angular, sorry for the react-native fans reading this but i had a few days to make this and it was easier
 to do something i already knew how to use than to learn how to use react-native frow scrach.
 
 I might come back to this app in the future or not idk.
